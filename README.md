# Anime-Database

This web app will be a database of anime.  Users will be able to click on an element representing an anime, and its information will be displayed on the DOM.  There user can add their own anime, as well as giving the anime a rating.  When rated, it'll go through a rating function which will calculate a new rating and update both the DOM and the database.
